 I'm trying to write a prompt for zero-shot instruction task that will help the most capable and suitable agent to solve the task.
  My current prompt is:
  [CURRENT PROMPT] "{instruction}"
  Now this prompt got the following examples correct:
  [CORRECT EXAMPLES] {examples}
  Since you cant use these examples, analyse and understand characteristics/complexity and diversity of these examples and their reasoning chain and
  accordingly provide suggestions to further improve the prompt and make it better as a zero shot instruction task.
